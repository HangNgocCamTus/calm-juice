        With HCMC in the grips of a strict two-month social distancing order, many Saigoneers are craving for a
        delectable bite of banh mi.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        The simple Vietnamese sandwich, a baguette stuffed with anything from grilled pork, cold cuts and cucumber
        slices to cilantro, pickled carrots, liver pate, and a swipe of mayonnaise, is arguably one of the first things
        you should try if you want a true taste of Vietnam.</h3><br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Here are eight famous banh mi variations that have won acclaim from food bloggers.

            <strong><i>Banh mi xiu mai trung muoi</i></strong> served with pork meatballs <i>(xiu mai)</i> and topped
            with salted
            egg yolk <i>(trung muoi)</i> is highly recommended by travel bloggers, stemming from a homemade recipe you
            can’t find anywhere else. Inside the freshly baked sandwich is one piece of roasted beef, two to three
            pieces of pork meatballs topped with protein-laden steamed salted egg yolk, along with layers of pork
            crackling. Don't forget to put a little pickled daikon and carrots and fish sauce into the loaf to add
            flavor.
            <br>The stall serving this version is at 6 Ho Xuan Huong Street in Binh Thanh District, with prices ranging
            from 22,000-30,000VND ($0.95-1.29).</br>

            <br><strong><i>Banh mi chao</i></strong> is one served with a frying pan <i>(chao)</i> with egg, pate and
            sausage.</br>
            <br>But this is just the basic version. A wide variety of "fillings" are available for hungry diners to
            choose from. The dish is usually served right after it is cooked. Typically, a mixture of chili and soy
            sauce are added to the dish before it is eaten. The egg yolk combined with seasoning makes for a greasy,
            tasty sauce that a piece of crispy bread is dipped into.</br>
            <br>One of the most ideal places to try it is the Hoa Ma stall on Dang Tran Con Street, District 1.
            The joint is open from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Each serving costs around 44,000VND.</br>

            <br>At 37 Nguyen Trai Street in District 5, part of Saigon's Chinatown, a vendor has been serving
            <strong><i>banh mi thit nuong</i></strong> with grilled pork <i>(chao)</i> from a pushcart for more than a
            decade.</br>
            <br>>he round pieces of minced pork, fragrant and slightly burnt, are taken directly from the hot coals in a
            small oven. Regular customers say they love how the grilled pork here has remained tasty for so many years,
            with people willing to wait half an hour to be served.</br>
            <br>The sandwich includes five or six pork patties coated in a sauce that smells and tastes nearly like
            yakitori. On top of the pork patties is a generous amount of cucumber, cilantro, green onion, Vietnamese
            pickles, and finally some sweet chili sauce. The stall opens at around 5 p.m., and the sandwich costs
            VND20,000 ($0.86).</br>

            <br><strong><i>Banh mi pha lau</i></strong> accompanied with a stew made of beef and pork entrails called
            <i>pha
                lau</i> (offal stew) is not a bad idea for Saigoneers, originating from China and imported to Saigon 100
            years ago.
            Diners can drop by Ms. Oanh's stall inside Xom Chieu Market of District 4, as recommended by food
            bloggers.</br>
            <br>The main ingredient of <i>pha lau</i> is beef offal – liver, stomach and tripe. On collecting an order,
            the owner starts to cut the offal into bite-sized chunks. She then puts them in a bowl, adding a fragrant,
            dense broth rendered richer with coconut milk. The long-shimmered beef offal is tender, juicy and
            crunchy.</br>
            <br>Adding to the enjoyment is the sweet and sour taste of fish sauce with some kumquat juice. Eaters can
            tell the owner if they want their sauce spicy or not.</br>
            <br>The shop at 200/48 Xom Chieu, District 4 has been in operation for 20 years and opens from 5 p.m. to 10
            p.m. The average price per serving is VND25,000 ($1.08).</br>

                        <br>For many Saigoneers, bread served with roasted pork, <strong><i>banh mi heo
                                quay</i></strong>, is not too strange. The pork is roasted with a thick layer of salt
                        and spices. It is sliced and served on a freshly baked bread roll. The sandwich is then dressed
                        with a combination of mayonnaise, pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, cilantro, and chives.
                        If desired, sliced chili peppers can be added as a topping, making it very spicy.</br>
                        <br>This version can be found at Phuc Hai's stall at 3 Nguyen Thuong Hien Street in District 3

                        seafood markets. The fish would be stewed for many hours with coconut water and tomatoes based
                        on varying recipes. Cooked fish are kept in a charcoal pot to keep it warm and reduce the fishy
                        flavor. When a customer places an order, the fish is mashed into a loaf of bread smeared with
                        mayonnaise, then topped with classic accompaniments like pickled carrots and daikon, coriander,
                        sliced chili peppers, and a drizzle of spicy tomato sauce.</br>

        What is it that has been making fashion socially and politically relevant?
    <p>
        <hr width="80%" align="center">
    <h3 style="text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        In the months leading up to the 2020 US Presidential elections, the socio-political climate in the United States
        of America was visibly turbulent. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, the country resounded with cries of
        racial injustice. Protests followed, and soon the world joined to participate in the Black Lives Matter movement
        – all in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Of the many things that came out of the movement, one was that the fashion and the cosmetic industry began to
        make strong political statements – more often about the importance of being aware of the socio-political
        happenings in the US and around the world, along with the significance of exercising the power to vote and bring
        about change.</h3><br>
    <img src="file:///C:/Users/hello/Desktop/4h13'.JPG" class="cangiua">
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        As brands began rolling out politically-relevant merchandise, celebrities took to social media to make public
        their political leanings. Hollywood began openly showing support for the socio-political movement, asking people
        to vote–one of the most effective ways of bringing about the change for which countless Americans had taken to
        the streets to protest. Accessories, clothing items, face masks that read ‘vote’, makeup trends and other
        similar fashion products, became more visible on social media and on America’s streets.

        A culture that inspires fashion
    </h2></br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        For 39-year-old Corey Wright from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, denim pants, fitted sweatshirts and T-shirts make up
        his wardrobe’ but it is his culture that influences his style. “I don’t dress for functionality, but for
        artistic purposes,” he tells indianexpress.com.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Ever since the BLM movement started, Wright’s fashion choices have changed. “Before this, I would buy something
        because I liked it. Now, I’m more specific about my purchases,” he says. Now before buying a piece of clothing,
        he asks himself several questions: where is the money going? What does the company stand for? Is it a
        Black-owned company?

        Just like Wright, Britnii Mitchell, 34, from Naperville, Illinois has found herself purchasing more apparel that
        symbolises the Black Lives Matter movement — T-shirts and shirts depicting iconic figures in the Black
        community, shirts with the movement’s slogans, etc. “I have always been a lover of highlighting Black history
        because I believe expressive fashion plays a significant role.”
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Even for 35-year-old Aundrea Parsons, a Chicago resident, her personal style is heavily influenced by her
        culture, “I am a Black American; style has always been a part of movements,” she says.

    <br>
    <h2

        ‘Don’t need the BLM movement to tell me I matter’
    </h2></br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        While racial discrimination has historically been a socio-political issue around the world, it took the Black
        Lives Matter movement to finally galvanize people. So then, how has it shaped or even reshaped personal fashion?
    </h3></br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        “In its true sense,” says Parsons, “the BLM movement is simply a continuation of the fight for equality.” Wright
        agrees, saying that while the movement has been around for a while, “it is sad that people are only now catching
        up to it”. “So when someone joins, instead of asking ‘where were you?’, I say ‘welcome’.”
    </h3></br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Parsons does not think that her personal style has changed much post the Black Lives Matter protests this past
        summer, but these days, she does buy more shirts that read ‘Black Lives Matter’ or those that have black comic
        superheroes on them like Storm, Black Panther, Misty Knight, Bishop and other similar characters. “I have
        another that says ‘Black Women Matter’”.
    </h3></br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/Jermaine-Thomas.jpg" class="cangiua">

    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        But for 48-year-old filmmaker Jermaine Thomas from Los Angeles, who thinks of himself as a “laid back guy with
        an ever laid back fashion”, his style has never really changed. “As a Black man, Black has always mattered to
        me. I grew up in the ‘80s, during which I saw many Blacks kill other Blacks. I don’t need a movement to tell me
        that I matter. I have always mattered.”
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Wright says now there is an increased interest in Black-owned businesses. “That’s not an exaggeration; fashion
        is a part of that search effort and I’ve contributed to that. I want Black brands to succeed and there’s no
        reason why they can’t or shouldn’t.”
    </h3></br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Mitchell, who is bi-racial and teaches in a predominantly White high school, believes that wearing outfits to
        represent a particular political stance has never been an issue for her. “Some parents have an issue with my
        leanings, but it just reminds me that I need to keep going.”
    </h3></br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Wright says he is comfortable expressing himself through his fashion because there are those who are
        “comfortable with their bigotry”. “So as long as those people exist, so will I.”
    </h3></br>
    <h2

        The politics of fashion

        Fashion intersecting with race isn’t recent. Take Donald Trump’s victory for example, that led to the
        popularization of ‘MAGA’ hats among his followers, over the past four years. So, what is it that has been making
        fashion socially and politically relevant? According to some members of the Black community whom
        indianexpress.com interviewed, the US Presidential elections have significantly changed the game.
    </h3></br>
    <br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Wright says it always happens whenever the country gets around to vote. “I believe there has been an increase in
        this type of gear, but not because of the election. The last four years have seen a spike in candidate support
        via fashion. I hate the dumb ‘Make America Great Again’ hats, but that is the sort of thing I’m addressing.
        Barring that, I think people are in a place where they want to identify themselves and what they stand for more
        readily.” </h3></br>
    <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/Aundrea-Parsons.jpeg" class="cangiua">

    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Parsons is of the opinion that the recent trend of making unconcealed statements through clothes and accessories
        is here to stay — even post the US elections. “Mostly because it’s been here before the elections. A brand’s job
        is to make money and make their ‘thing’ a household name. I don’t personally think there’s anything wrong with a
        brand aligning themselves with something positive like a ‘VOTE’ merchandise,” she says. </h3></br>
    <h3 style=" text-align: justify; text-indent:-1px;margin-right:140px;margin-left: 140px;">
        Thomas however, has a slightly different view. He says that American social movements tend to be an ‘in the
        moment’ kind of thing. “We are always revved up during elections. Trends come and go here in the US. Not many
        fashion statements stay around for a long time. That’s why I try not to get caught up in them,” he says. “Also,
        America is an opportunistic country. We are experts at cashing in on the latest trends. As long as something is
        hot and trending, there is money to be made.”</h3></br>
